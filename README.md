# ML Iris Classification in Python
Welcome to the ML Iris Classification project! This project applies various machine learning algorithms to the classic Iris dataset using Python. It serves as an introduction to supervised learning, model evaluation, and predictive analysis using the Scikit-learn framework.

# Project Overview
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, classified into 3 species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

Each sample has 4 numerical features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

The goal of this project is to build predictive models that can classify a flower’s species based on these features.

# Technologies & Libraries Used
Python 3.9+

Jupyter Notebook

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

NumPy

You can install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
# What You'll Find Inside
In the notebooks, you’ll see:

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Data visualization (pair plots, histograms, correlation heatmaps)
 Data preprocessing (e.g., normalization, encoding if needed)
 Model training using:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Naive Bayes
 Cross-validation and model comparison
 Confusion matrix and performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
Final model evaluation on a validation/test set

# Results Summary
After comparing models using cross-validation, the SVM classifier gave the best accuracy (~97%) on the validation set.

# Future Work
Some possible improvements:

Add hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit

Use PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualize decision boundaries

Try deep learning with TensorFlow or PyTorch for experimentation
